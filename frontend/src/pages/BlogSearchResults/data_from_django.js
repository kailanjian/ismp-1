Looking after your mind and body can help prevent you from feeling overwhelmed and stressed, while making you feel healthier, more motivated and stronger.</p>\n<p>This is the time to make new patterns and healthy habits in your everyday life to help you be your best self. To help you get started, here are our mental health tips and self-care advice for students studying at home.</p>\n<h2><strong>What is self-care and how can it help my mental health?</strong></h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30446 tc-smart-load-skip tc-smart-loaded" style="display: inline;" src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mental-health.png" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mental-health.png 889w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mental-health-300x90.png 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mental-health-150x45.png 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mental-health-768x231.png 768w" alt="" /></figure>\n<p>Practicing self-care is one of the best way to manage your mental health symptoms. It isn&rsquo;t about one specific set of activities or daily rituals that you complete, but it&rsquo;s altering your mindset by changing your habits and doing things just for you.</p>\n<p>We know it isn&rsquo;t easy dedicating time to look after yourself when you have so many things to do and so many other people to worry about, but you have to get over any guilt you may feel for doing things for yourself and learn how to make space in your life for self-care.</p>\n<p>Creating new mindful habits will help you build a lifestyle that is fulfilling and meaningful to you, instead of just going through the motions. There&rsquo;s so much pressure to constantly be doing something productive, with the expectation that it&rsquo;ll lead to successful studies, when in actuality sometimes taking a step back can put you in a stronger position to succeed.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why is self-care important for students and how can I learn to practice it?</strong></h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30430 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920-1024x683.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/video-conference-5162927_1920.jpg 1920w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n<p>We want to be the whole package &ndash; to excel in our studies, have an active social life, stay fit and healthy, be part of a society, travel to see new places, stay connected to family&hellip; there&rsquo;s so much to cram in. We fear missing out and can quickly think of ourselves as failures if we struggle to live up to the expectations that we create for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Self-care is about respecting yourself and being kind to yourself. It&rsquo;s about loosening the pressure we put on ourselves and taking the time to relax and unwind. You will find fulfilment from varying self-care activities depending on who you are and what you like to do, but here are some examples to get you thinking:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pamper yourself.</strong> As strange as it sounds, staying on top of your personal hygiene (even if you can&rsquo;t leave the house!) will help you feel ready to take on the day. You could also run yourself a bubble bath, put on a facemask or give yourself a manicure.</li>\n<li><strong>Go outside if you can.</strong> Spending time outdoors can reduce stress levels and help you feel more energetic and mindful. Whether you go for a walk or sit down in a park, breathing in fresh air and feeling the sun on your skin is definitely a mood booster.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend time with a pet.</strong> Animals are known to help reduce stress in humans just by petting them. The companionship and love they give us does wonders for self-care!</li>\n<li><strong>Organise your living space.</strong> Waking up to an organised space puts you in the right frame of mind to organise your studies. As the expression goes, &ldquo;tidy space, tidy mind&rdquo;.</li>\n<li><strong>Cook something you love to eat.</strong> Eating healthy foods such as vegetables and nuts can help improve our moods and keep us alert, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should throw out &lsquo;junk&rsquo; food that you enjoy eating. Moderation is the key!</li>\n<li><strong>Hit pause and read a book.</strong> It&rsquo;s a known fact that social media can make us feel more anxious and stressed, so why not put your phone away and pick up a book you enjoy reading? It&rsquo;s a great way to slow down and be more mindful.</li>\n<li><strong>Find a new hobby.</strong> Finding a balance between studying and doing something creative, like learning to crochet or drawing, will help clear and refresh your mind. But importantly, don&rsquo;t put pressure on yourself to master your hobby straight away!</li>\n<li><strong>Decorate your space.</strong> Personalising your living space will create a more meaningful environment to live and study in. Fill your home with plants to help purify the air you breathe, create or find art to hang up, or add some fairy lights to soothe the space.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>I hear &ldquo;be kind to yourself&rdquo; a lot &ndash;&nbsp;what does this mean?</strong></h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30442 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/be-kind-to-yourself-.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/be-kind-to-yourself-.jpg 910w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/be-kind-to-yourself--300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/be-kind-to-yourself--150x100.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/be-kind-to-yourself--768x512.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /></figure>\n<p>&lsquo;Be kind to yourself&rsquo; simply means cut yourself some slack. Try not to beat yourself up if you don&rsquo;t get everything on your to-do list done. Accept that you are only human, and you can only do a limited number of things in a day. Release the impossibly high standards that you&rsquo;ve set for yourself and accept that being perfect is an impossible task.</p>\n<iframe id="instagram-embed-0" class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: white; max-width: 540px; width: calc(100% - 2px); border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; box-shadow: none; display: block; margin: 0px 0px 12px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/CAUKUCgivrO/embed/?cr=1&amp;v=12&amp;wp=540&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.intostudy.com&amp;rp=%2Fhow-to-with-into%2Fhow-to-look-after-your-mental-health-while-studying-from-home%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A2644.289999996545%2C%22ls%22%3A2349.984999978915%2C%22le%22%3A2360.0949999818113%7D" height="509" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-instgrm-payload-id="instagram-media-payload-0"></iframe>\n<p>Try not to compare yourself to your friends, classmates or people on social media.

Staying active can help you feel better both physically and mentally, improve your mood and reduce stress. Simple exercises such as running, walking and yoga are easy to fit into a busy schedule, or you could download a fitness game on your games console if you struggle to concentrate on traditional forms of exercise!</p>\n<p>Sleep is another thing that has a huge impact on your life. Not getting enough sleep can make your emotions feel heightened and make you feel sluggish and unmotivated. But what&rsquo;s the secret to a good sleep? You should consider your nightly routine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When did you last consume caffeine?</li>\n<li>What time do you settle down to sleep?</li>\n<li>What could you do to relax at the end of a stressful day?</li>\n<li>Are there distractions in your room keeping you awake?</li>\n<li>Does the sun shine through your window and wake you up too early in the morning?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Addressing these points could help you make great strides in having a better sleep. You could also try deep breathing exercises and other mindfulness techniques to reduce stress levels and increase calmness. Apps such as &lsquo;Headspace&rsquo; are popular choices for beginners.</p>\n<h2><strong>Who can I talk to if I&rsquo;m feeling stressed or overwhelmed?</strong></h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30443 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-1024x683.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photos_6386_person-woman-hand-smartphone-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n<p>It&rsquo;s important for your mental health to stay connected to loved ones, no matter if you&rsquo;re away attending face-to-face classes or you&rsquo;re studying online from home. As an international student, not being able to see friends and family from home can be really difficult, but fortunately <a href="https://blog.intostudy.com/living-abroad/lifestyle/5-best-video-apps-for-staying-in-touch-with-loved-ones/">there are many apps that can help us feel connected</a> such as Skype, Zoom, Houseparty and WhatsApp.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling overwhelmed by your workload or for other personal reasons, ask a friend or family member to have a video chat. While you can&rsquo;t have face-to-face contact, chatting to someone via video can release the same dopaminergic rewards in your brain as when you&rsquo;re physically with them.</p>\n<p>If you feel like you can&rsquo;t talk to close friends and family about any issues you&rsquo;re experiencing, counselling is a great option to explore. Talking to an impartial person who is completely separate from your social &lsquo;bubble&rsquo; can be a truly freeing experience.</p>\n<h2><strong>Remember: whatever your circumstances, you&rsquo;ve got this</strong>!</h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30444 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this-1024x682.jpeg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Youve-got-this.jpeg 1880w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n<p>Please be kinder to yourself and make more time for self-care to see the positive effects take shape in your life and mental wellbeing.

Write notes during class</strong></h4>\n<p>Writing notes helps you recall your lecture all over again in your brain while studying for a test/exam.</p>\n<p>Be it short notes or just a hint of the story your teacher told you to explain a certain topic, every single bit helps.</p>\n<p>A Chinese proverb explains the importance of notes, by saying that if you see something, or repeat it out loud&nbsp;you may forget it.</p>\n<p>However, if you see something, repeat it and scribble it somewhere, nothing can make you forget it.</p>\n<p class=""><img class="alignnone wp-image-23027 tc-smart-load-skip tc-smart-loaded" style="display: inline;" src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/notes-1.gif" alt="Taking notes in class" width="590" height="282" /></p>\n<h4><strong>3. Ask questions</strong></h4>\n<p>&ldquo;Those who ask questions during class might look like fa ool for 5 minutes, but those who don&rsquo;t ask, stay fools for la ifetime&rdquo;, so why not just ask the question and clear out your confusion?</p>\n<p class=""><img class="alignnone wp-image-22965 tc-smart-load-skip tc-smart-loaded" style="display: inline;" src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/question.gif" alt="Raise your hand for a question" width="590" height="332" /></p>\n<h4><strong>4. Stop leaving everything to the 23rd hour!</strong></h4>\n<p>Studying one day before the exam is really common, but it&rsquo;s also one of the worst things you&nbsp;can do.</p>\n<p>Even if you&nbsp;manage to get a good grade after an overnight study, you can definitely never manage to get an outstanding grade.</p>\n<p>Overnight study retains in your brain only for some time. If you really want to make it stick, you have to keep on revising it every day. At least after every few days!</p>\n<p>Spread out your work and review class materials several times.</p>\n<h4><strong><img class="alignnone wp-image-22966 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Sleeping at your desk" width="590" height="395" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nightstudy.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nightstudy.jpg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nightstudy-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nightstudy-300x201.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nightstudy-768x514.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></strong></h4>\n<h4><strong>5. Revise what happened in the last class and read further</strong></h4>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a very good idea to revise the work you did in your last class.</p>\n<p>It would hardly take 15 minutes but it will recall everything.</p>\n<p>You can answer to the questions your teacher may ask or you can pass a surprise test with that.</p>\n<div class="mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle" style="display: none !important;">&nbsp;</div>\n<p>If you really wish to excel&nbsp;in class then put on extra 15 minutes and read ahead.</p>\n<p>Reading topics before you study them in class works wonders. You will realise how simple actually everything is and your teacher will totally love you for being the &ldquo;smartest kid&rdquo;.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23029 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Preparatory reading" width="590" height="332" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/giphy-20.gif" /></p>\n<h4><strong>6.&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.intostudy.com/studying/exams-revision/the-perfect-revision-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find a comfortable place to study</a></strong></h4>\n<p>Where you plan to study should be clean, with good lighting and few distractions.</p>\n<p>liKeep chocolate and a water bottle with you, as it helps in giving oxygen to your brain and chocolate retains energy.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22968 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Instagram Study Space Inspiration" width="590" height="590" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/@diaryofamedstudent.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/@diaryofamedstudent.jpg 640w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/@diaryofamedstudent-150x150.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/@diaryofamedstudent-300x300.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/@diaryofamedstudent-160x160.jpg 160w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/@diaryofamedstudent-320x320.jpg 320w" data-sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>\n<h4><strong>7. Take short breaks</strong></h4>\n<p>Breaks help you relax and concentrate while studying.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s said to be a healthy study when studied with a 10 minute break after every 45 minutes.</p>\n<p>Your memory retains information that you study at the beginning and the end, better than in the middle.</p>\n<p>Either do some exercise during the break, or just shut your eyes and try not to think about anything in that time.&nbsp;Try&nbsp;not to use any technology.</p>\n<p>It may help in dealing with your social media cravings, but trust me, catching up on your phone&nbsp;does not aid&nbsp;relaxing your mind. Instead, it can burn you out.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-23020 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Take a break and meditate" width="590" height="332" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meditation.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meditation.jpg 1920w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meditation-150x84.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meditation-300x169.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meditation-768x432.jpg 768w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/meditation-1024x576.jpg 1024w" data-sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>\n<h4><strong>8. Get plenty of sleep</strong></h4>\n<p>One of the most vital things to ensure a healthy studying lifestyle is making sure you get&nbsp;8 hours sleep.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22970 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Sleeping a full 8 hours" width="590" height="332" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/sleep.gif" /></p>\n<p>Less sleep can lead to your brain slowing down. To stay healthy for a long time you have to put sleep as a priority.9. Reward yourself</p>\n<p>Get yourself a new item of clothing or a tasty treat.</p>\n<p>This helps&nbsp;motivate you to learn more and more, and the snack will help perk you up for the next part of your study session!</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-22969 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="New clothes as a study incentive" width="590" height="295" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/newclothes.gif" /></p>\n--/.pagination--&gt;</div>',

Make the most of your study time </strong></h4>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t just panic, bury your head in a heap of books and hope for the best. Get organised.</p>\n<p>Make a schedule and work out how much time you need for each subject.</p>\n<p>Study a little each day and give your brain a break every 45 minutes. Avoid cramming the night before &ndash; it&rsquo;s not the way to guarantee a good mark.</p>\n<iframe id="instagram-embed-0" class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: white; max-width: 540px; width: calc(100% - 2px); border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; box-shadow: none; display: block; margin: 0px 0px 12px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BmQtsJRAzNR/embed/?cr=1&amp;v=9&amp;wp=540&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.intostudy.com&amp;rp=%2Fstudying%2Fexams-revision%2F8-simple-tips-for-exam-success%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A1056.9700000050943%2C%22ls%22%3A651.3850000046659%2C%22le%22%3A654.6650000091176%7D" height="565" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-instgrm-payload-id="instagram-media-payload-0"></iframe>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/intostudy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow us on Instagram.</a></p>\n<h4><strong>2. Don&rsquo;t just study solo&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n<p>Why not form a study group with friends? It&rsquo;ll provide you with variety and moral support, plus it&rsquo;s motivating to have people around you who are working towards the same goals.<img class="wp-image-10255 aligncenter tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Students studying outside" width="612" height="408" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Students-studying-outside.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Students-studying-outside.jpg 600w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Students-studying-outside-300x200.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>\n<h4><strong>3. Deal with your stress</strong></h4>\n<p>Exam stress is perfectly normal &ndash; in fact, a little bit of stress can be a positive motivator.</p>\n<p>However, too much of it can negatively affect your performance.</p>\n<p>So take regular breaks, exercise daily, and spend time relaxing with friends. If you begin to feel frustrated or overwhelmed, step away from the books for a while.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25458 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="relax" width="960" height="538" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/realx.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/realx.jpg 960w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/realx-150x84.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/realx-300x168.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/realx-768x430.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>\n<h4><strong>4. Ask for help</strong></h4>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask your teachers for help &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be glad to assist.</p>\n<p>If you need clarification on a topic you&rsquo;re struggling with, then ask them to talk you through it. Don&rsquo;t panic in silence when there&rsquo;s a support network around you.<strong><br /></strong></p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-24605 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" width="1024" height="681" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/INTO-CITY-1-1024x681.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/INTO-CITY-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/INTO-CITY-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/INTO-CITY-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/INTO-CITY-1-768x511.jpg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>\n<div class="mailmunch-forms-in-post-middle" style="display: none !important;">&nbsp;</div>\n<h4><strong>5. Get plenty of sleep</strong></h4>\n<p>Rest is good for your brain. Get a full eight hours sleep each night and avoid studying till the early hours.</p>\n<p>Sleep is vital to exam success.</p>\n<h4><strong>6. Prep the night before</strong></h4>\n<p>Pack everything you need into a bag the night before &ndash; this way you can avoid a last minute rush the next day.</p>\n<p>Essential items might include pens, pencils, a calculator and water.<img class="wp-image-10259 aligncenter tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Girl studying" width="499" height="751" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Girl-studying.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Girl-studying.jpg 399w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Girl-studying-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Girl-studying-300x451.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px" /></p>\n<h4><strong>7. Make the most of your morning </strong></h4>\n<p>Get up early and eat breakfast &ndash; whether you feel like it or not.</p>\n<p>Hunger will slow down your brain, plus who wants a rumbling tummy in the exam room?</p>\n<p>Also, make sure to wear comfortable clothes with layers you can add or remove &ndash; you don&rsquo;t know how warm or cold the exam room will be.</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-25468 size-large tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="Have a healthy breakfast before exams" width="1024" height="681" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/breakfast-1024x681.jpeg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/breakfast-1024x681.jpeg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/breakfast-150x100.jpeg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/breakfast-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/breakfast-768x511.jpeg 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>\n<h4><strong>8. When you&rsquo;re in the exam room&hellip; take your time</strong></h4>\n<p>When waiting outside the exam room, avoid the temptation to discuss what you&rsquo;ve studied with your friends. You&rsquo;ll probably all have studied slightly different things so don&rsquo;t panic each other!</p>\n<p>Just sit quietly outside the room, breathe deeply and avoid looking at your notes. Once inside, read the exam instructions very carefully. Allocate time for each question and keep an eye on the clock.</p>\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t know the answer to a question, skip it and return to it later. Never leave an exam early, use your time given to fully complete and revise your answers. And remember &ndash; you can only do your best.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Good luck! </em></strong></p>\n-/.pagination--&gt;</div>',

I use a planner in which I jot down a to-do list for the following day. In the list, I prioritise my tasks based on deadlines, importance and interest. I usually start with the task I want to do least and work my way down the list.</li>\n<li><strong>Take lots of breaks.</strong> I try to take a break every so often, and usually try to do something completely different, like playing with my dog. I try to work during normal school hours so that I can be efficient with my work, plan wisely and allow myself to switch off and relax in my downtime.</li>\n<li><strong>Find activities you enjoy.</strong> It&rsquo;s important to find things to do, even during lockdown when we can&rsquo;t leave the house regularly. My family and I have been binge-watching a lot of shows on Netflix and playing lots of board games. I have a younger brother with a similar interest in video games as me, so we play a lot of those.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay connected with your teachers!</strong> Teachers have been very helpful, giving timely updates on everything and responding to emails quickly, even over the weekends. They give very detailed feedback and make sure there isn&rsquo;t any miscommunication, so the current circumstances don&rsquo;t stop our learning. I also have a group chat with some of my classmates. We keep in touch to discuss deadlines, the syllabus and share any new information with each other. We also call often and study together to make sure we don&rsquo;t get bored.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Jacqueline, Malaysia: find different ways to motivate yourself</strong></h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30370 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-683x1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-200x300.jpg 200w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-100x150.jpg 100w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_3168-edit-scaled.jpg 1707w" data-sizes="(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /></figure>\n<p>Jacqueline, originally from Malaysia and now living in Singapore, progressed to BSc (Hons) Psychology at the <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Exeter</a> after studying an International Year One at INTO Exeter.

The app is really cute &ndash; you &lsquo;plant a tree&rsquo; which grows while you&rsquo;re not using your phone. If you go on your phone the tree wilts, but if you manage to reach your target time without checking your phone, your tree is added to your &lsquo;forest&rsquo; and you get a coin. Get enough coins and you can plant a real tree! This helps me block out distractions and concentrate on my studies, and it&rsquo;s even a chance to help the environment.</li>\n<li><strong>Spend time with the people around you.</strong> Spending quality time with my family helps me cope with the current challenges. My mum and I have been cooking a lot &ndash; there&rsquo;s a Chinese dessert we made called Qing Tang. She was really proud of the end product! I feel like this strange period of time has been a blessing in disguise where I get to spend more time with my family and savour every moment that we have with each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Virtually hang out with your friends.</strong> I&rsquo;ve also been taking time for myself and have been going online quite a bit to game with my friends &ndash; I feel we do need to find something that we enjoy doing to take our mind off this stressful situation!</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Sofiia, Ukraine: make the most of your free time</strong></h2>\n<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img class="wp-image-30371 tc-smart-load-skip" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" alt="" data-src="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-1024x683.jpg" data-srcset="https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.intostudy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_1857-edit2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>\n<p>Sofiia studied the <a href="https://www.intostudy.com/en/universities/university-of-exeter/courses/international-foundation-in-economics-finance-and-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Foundation in Economics, Finance and Management</a> before she progressed to her degree in BSc (Hons) Accounting and Finance at the University of Exeter, which she&rsquo;s now studying at home in Ukraine. Here are her tips for maintaining a daily routine at home.</p>\n<ol type="1">\n<li><strong>Get up as you usually would.</strong> During quarantine, it&rsquo;s better to maintain the old daily routine and not be tempted by the idea of waking up and falling asleep later. This will help you to feel full of energy and spend your time effectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Use the time to get the maximum benefit for yourself.</strong> Write a list of things you have always put off. Things you told yourself you&rsquo;d start doing, like morning exercises or improving your English skills. Use the opportunity of free access to online courses to learn something new. Many platforms, such as Coursera, have made all their courses free during the quarantine. This is a great time to do things you don&rsquo;t have time to do usually.</li>\n<li><strong>If you&rsquo;re at home, communicate with your family.</strong> Discuss your work schedule and help them to understand that you are not on vacation &ndash; work is ongoing, and it&rsquo;s important for you to focus on it. Set a timetable and agree what time you are working so you aren&rsquo;t distracted and know when you can spend time all together. Remember they&rsquo;re also in a difficult situation &ndash; share responsibility for household chores to support your family, ask where and how to help and try not to create additional stress.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Hugo, Hong Kong: stay in touch with friends and family</strong></h2>\n<iframe id="instagram-embed-0" class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: white; max-width: 540px; width: calc(100% - 2px); border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; box-shadow: none; display: block; margin: 0px 0px 12px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz1uLBdATPC/embed/?cr=1&amp;v=12&amp;wp=540&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.intostudy.com&amp;rp=%2Finto-centres%2Fuk-centres%2Finto-university-of-exeter%2Fthe-international-student-guide-to-a-work-life-balance-while-staying-home%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A1299.955000024056%2C%22ls%22%3A1156.9650000019465%2C%22le%22%3A1169.6000000229105%7D" height="746" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-instgrm-payload-id="instagram-media-payload-0"></iframe>\n<p>Hugo, a former INTO student, decided to stay at his home in Exeter, where he&rsquo;s studying for his degree in BSc (Hons) Management and Marketing.

All of my flatmates went back home and I&rsquo;m living on my own, so I&rsquo;ve been keeping busy! When I&rsquo;m not studying, I&rsquo;ve set up a &lsquo;home gym&rsquo; to keep fit and I like to play piano and guitar to pass the time. I&rsquo;m also reading a lot to keep learning, even in my free time.</li>\n<li><strong>Change out of your pyjamas!</strong> I like to study in the living room as it gets some sunshine and it&rsquo;s far from the bedroom, which boosts my motivation and concentration to study. I&rsquo;m not the kind of person that could work efficiently sat on the bed. I also heard that wearing proper clothes will increase your work efficiency more than wearing pyjamas because it sends a message to your brain that it&rsquo;s time to work. So get changed for work!</li>\n<li><strong>Keep in contact with people in your life.</strong> Staying connected to friends and family is important so I&rsquo;ve been using lots of apps to talk to them, such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Zoom, Skype and mobile games we can play together.</li>\n</ol>\n<iframe id="instagram-embed-1" class="instagram-media instagram-media-rendered" style="background: white; max-width: 540px; width: calc(100% - 2px); border-radius: 3px; border: 1px solid #dbdbdb; box-shadow: none; display: block; margin: 0px 0px 12px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0px;" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-9mAeEnufy/embed/captioned/?cr=1&amp;v=12&amp;wp=540&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.intostudy.com&amp;rp=%2Finto-centres%2Fuk-centres%2Finto-university-of-exeter%2Fthe-international-student-guide-to-a-work-life-balance-while-staying-home%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A1%2C%22os%22%3A1304.4250000093598%2C%22ls%22%3A1156.9650000019465%2C%22le%22%3A1169.6000000229105%7D" height="1026" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-instgrm-payload-id="instagram-media-payload-1"></iframe>\n<p><strong><em>You may also like to read <a href="https://blog.intostudy.com/how-to-with-into/top-tips-to-stay-motivated-while-studying-from-home/">our top tips to stay motived while studying from home</a> or <a href="http://blog.intostudy.com/into-centres/uk-centres/into-queens-university-belfast/successful-university-study/">9 secrets to successful study</a>.</em></strong></p>\n!--/.pagination--&gt;</div>',

Light, regular exercise can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improve your concentration</li>\n<li>help you be more productive</li>\n<li>give you a boost of happy endorphins</li>\n<li>make sure you get a proper night&rsquo;s sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no need to do a full-on bootcamp workout every day, but we&rsquo;ve put together a few ideas to help you make movement part of your daily routine. This is the perfect time to try new activities &ndash; and who knows, you might find your new favourite hobby!</p>\n<p>From barely any effort to a more strenuous workout, here are six ways to stay active while studying at home:</p>\n<h2>Stand up more</h2>\n<iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/3oz8xysJuWtO9UgUlG" width="480" height="240" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p>Probably the easiest and most accessible way to stay active is simply to get up and walk around a bit! At least once an hour is recommended, but do it as often as you like &ndash; just set a timer to remind you. You should feel refreshed, energised, and ready to focus on your work again.</p>\n<p>Try a reminder-setting app such as Randomly RemindMe, StandUp &ndash; the Work Breaker Timer or Move &ndash; Daily Activity to Stay Healthy.</p>\n<p>There are lots of other ways to increase your activity little-and-often &ndash; so little that you&rsquo;ll hardly even notice it. If you&rsquo;re on the phone, have a wander as you talk &ndash; and I&rsquo;m pretty sure walking to the kitchen to grab a snack counts, too!</p>\n<h2>Interactive gym classes</h2>\n<div class="tenor-gif-embed" style="width: 100%; position: relative;" data-postid="16759838" data-share-method="host" data-width="100%" data-aspect-ratio="0.9899598393574296" data-processed="true">\n<div style="padding-top: 101.01419878296147%;"><iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://tenor.com/embed/16759838?canonicalurl=https://blog.intostudy.com/living-abroad/lifestyle/how-to-stay-active-while-studying-at-home/" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>\n</div>\n<p>Since the schools have closed, children around the UK are now being taught lessons at home &ndash; including gym and PE.

Whether you prefer Kinect Sports Rivals for the Xbox One, Ring Fit Adventure for the Nintendo Switch or BOXVR for the Playstation 4, you&rsquo;re sure to find a fitness game to suit you and your console.</p>\n<h2>Get your clean on</h2>\n<iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/RNDdIRbOM7hKH9ezKz" width="480" height="204" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>\n<p>A tidy space equals a tidy mind, so why not get productive while you move and give your room a spring clean? It might not sound like much, but cleaning increases your heart rate and burns calories &ndash; and with a sparkling space in which to work, your studying will improve too!</p>\n<p>Vigorous housework for 30 minutes (that&rsquo;s if you really work up a sweat!) has the same effect as a brisk walk for the same length of time, but you&rsquo;ll have finished the washing up at the end of it. A win-win situation, if you ask us!</p>\n</div>',
